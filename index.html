    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <p>
      The history of Jamaica over the past 500 years has been marked by the
      courage of the Jamaican people in their triumphant struggle for freedom
      and justice and by their unrelenting resistance and determination in the
      face of adversity and discrimination. Modern Jamaica is built on a
      historical legacy of genocide perpetrated against the island’s indigenous
      peoples, on the experience of over three hundred years of slavery and
      oppression suffered by the Jamaicans of African origin and on the
      interplay between Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East in the building
      of a proud, free and progressive nation in the heart of the Caribbean.

      almost 900 years, the Tainos were wiped out within 50 years of the Spanish
      conquest in 1494, due to exploitation by the Spanish settlers, starvation
      and a lack of resistance to European diseases. Many Tainos fiercely
      resisted the Spanish occupation of their land and some even committed
      suicide rather than serve as slaves. The Arawak language spoken by the
      Tainos survives in many words such as ‘hammock’, ‘hurricane’, ‘tobacco’,
      ‘barbeque’ and ‘canoe’. The word Jamaica actually derives from the Arawak
      word Xaymaca, meaning “Land of wood and water”. The Spanish Period
